For PeriDEM simulation for two-particle test, they have taken

Circular particle radius: r = 1 mm
Mesh size = 1/8*r = 1/8 mm
Initial distance between the centers of the particles: 3 mm
The particle on top falls under gravity.
Contact radius: R_c = mesh size = 1/8 mm
Formula for cnot = 24 lambda/ (pi * delta^3)


Young's modulus: E = 3.24 GPa (3.24e9 Pa)
Poissson ratio: nu = 0.22
Density of the particle: rho = 1200 
Interval of simulation: t \in [0, 0.02]
Timestep: dt = 0.02/10^5
Number of timesteps: 1e5
