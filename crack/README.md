# Crack propagation through media using nonlocal PDE

See Reference.

# Requirements

MATLAB with image processing toolbox

OR,

OCTAVE 

# Usage

* To create the reference neighbourhood array: ref. Took 48s on my CPU.
`ref = nbd();`

* Draw the initial mesh
`drawmesh(ref);  `

* Create the final neighbourhood array, final, from the initial array, ref
`final = proj(ref);   `

* Draw the final array
`drawmesh(final);  `
* You can plot the neighbourhood weight matrix using
`nbdmap(final);`
* You can plot the relative neighbourhood weight matrix by
`damamge(final);`
* You can zoom in and out on the picture generated by `drawmesh();`.
