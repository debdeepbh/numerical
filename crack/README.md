# De-noising images 



# Requirements

MATLAB with image processing toolbox

OR,

OCTAVE with image package for octave like this:

0. Install octave
1. Download the image package from https://octave.sourceforge.io/packages.php
2. Run octave with `octave`.
3. Install the package `pkg install /path/to/image-pkg.tar.gz`
4. Load package with `pkg load image`

# Usage

* To create the reference neighbourhood array: ref. Should take 48s on a decent CPU.
`ref = nbd();`

* Draw the initial mesh
`drawmesh(ref);  `

* Create the final neighbourhood array, final, from the initial array, ref
`final = proj(ref);   `

* Draw the final array
`drawmesh(final);  `


* You can plot the neighbourhood weight matrix using
`nbdmap(final);`
* You can plot the relative neighbourhood weight matrix by
`damamge(final);`
* You can zoom in and out on the picture generated by `drawmesh();`.
