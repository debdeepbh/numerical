# Crack propagation through media using nonlocal PDE

See Reference.

# Requirements

MATLAB with image processing toolbox

OR,

OCTAVE 

# Example
Crack propagation and branching in soda-lime glass with a pre-notch under external force in the outward vertical direction
![crack-branching](meshout.gif)

# Usage

* To create the reference neighbourhood array.
```
[ref, dx, dy, nx, ny, delta] = nbd_test();
``` 
Took 48s on my CPU.

* Draw the initial mesh for the slab with a pre-notch
`drawmesh(ref, dx, dy, nx, ny);  `

* Create the final neighbourhood array for the cracked slab, from the initial array
```
[final, uvec] = proj_test(ref, dx, dy, nx, ny, delta);   
```  
This is where all the computations happen.

* Draw the final array
`drawmesh(final, dx, dy, nx, ny);  `

* Plot the deformed location of the nodes using `plotdispl(...)`
* You can plot the damage (ratio of broken bonds with respect to the reference configuration) with
`damamge_test(ref, final, nx, ny);`
* You can zoom in and out on the picture generated by `drawmesh();`.
